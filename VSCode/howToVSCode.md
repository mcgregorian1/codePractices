# Visual Studio Code

## What is it?
VSCode is an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio, but it supports many more coding languages and has other methods of helping people code faster, like extensions. It can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- For general documentation, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).
- For a more in-depth overview of why people like it, see [here](https://shiftmag.dev/vs-code-171/) from 2023.

## Tutorial
My labmate Xiaojie Gao gave a presentation about using R in VSCode during our PhD in 2022 and he put his resources on GitHub - you can find them [here](https://github.com/MrJGao/vscode_r_intro).

## Other useful information
### Extensions
VSCode runs on extensions, some of which are provided by default and many others that individuals have created. Extensions are used both for using your coding language (like R or Python) and for facilitating how you code (like allowing you to fold coding chunks).

Here are some extensions that are helpful:
- #region folding
- Code spell checker
- Better comments
- Color Pick (choose colors interactively in R (e.g.))
- Project Manager (similar to "Projects" in RStudio)
- Rainbow CSV (color codes csv columns when viewed in VSCode)

Some other extensions that are good too
- Live Share (allows you to look at the same document with someone else and edit like a google doc)
- Markdown All in One

Of course, you also need to add the extension for the coding language you're using, e.g.
- R
- Python

### Keyboard shortcuts
VSCode has **many** keybindings (keyboard shortcuts). Here are a couple useful ones
- collapse all code chunks = cmd + k + 0
- open all code chunks = cmd + k + cmd + j
- open a terminal = cmd + j
